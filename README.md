(d)

9.26897986e-05    b1
56.27901423021722    b0 intercept

Sometimes the intercept may have some meaningful insights to give and sometimes it is just there to fit the data. In this case b0 = 56.27 has not a relevant interpretation. In case a worker receives zero income, the average score assigned is 56.27.
Subjective riches increases on average 9.26897986e-05 if workers' income increases by one unit, other variables remaining constant.

Subjective riches  = 56.27901423021722     +    9.26897986e-05  * ( income )

(e) 

(f)
It is an interesting variable for the study, but it is very likely that the household size variable has a high correlation with income. Two independent variables with high correlation is a multicollinearity problem. Variance inflation factor will be useful to detect these cases
